**Quickly and easily access any RESTful or RESTful-like API.**

If you are looking for the SendGrid API client library, please see [this repo](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php).

# Announcements

All updates to this library is documented in our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sendgrid/php-http-client/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- PHP version 5.6 or 7.0

## Install with Composer

Add php-http-client to your `composer.json` file. If you are not using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org), you should be. It's an excellent way to manage dependencies in your PHP application.

```json
{
  "require": {
    "sendgrid/php-http-client": "3.3"
  }
}
```

Then at the top of your PHP script require the autoloader:

```php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```

Then from the command line:

```bash
composer install
```

# Quick Start

Here is a quick example:

`GET /your/api/{param}/call`

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$global_headers = array(Authorization: Basic XXXXXXX);
$client = SendGrid\Client('base_url', 'global_headers');
$response = $client->your()->api()->_($param)->call()->get();
print $response->statusCode();
print $response->headers();
print $response->body();
```

`POST /your/api/{param}/call` with headers, query parameters and a request body with versioning.

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$global_headers = array(Authorization: Basic XXXXXXX);
$client = SendGrid\Client('base_url', 'global_headers');
$query_params = array('hello' => 0, 'world' => 1);
$request_headers = array('X-Test' => 'test');
$data = array('some' => 1, 'awesome' => 2, 'data' => 3);
$response = $client->your()->api()->_($param)->call()->post('data',
                                                            'query_params',
                                                            'request_headers');
print $response->statusCode();
print $response->headers();
print $response->body();
```
